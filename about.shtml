  <h1 class="title">About Us</h1>

  <div class="content" style="width:930px;">
   <h2 class="subtitle">Our Mission</h2>
   The Tri-Valley Stargazers (TVS) is an amateur astronomy club based in Livermore, California with
   members from throughout the Tri-Valley and surrounding communities. The club's mission is to
   bring together individuals interested in astronomy, to provide opportunities for them to develop
   their skills and knowledge in astronomy and related subjects, and to promote education and public
   interest in astronomy. TVS is a registered non-profit organization and is entirely run by
   volunteers.  Our Tax Identification Number is 68-0243508, and you can reach us at P.O. Box 2476, 
   Livermore, CA 94551.

   <h2 class="subtitle">Club Meetings</h2>
   TVS holds club meetings on the third Friday of every month at the 
   <a href="http://www.uucil.org/" title="Visit the church" target="_blank">Unitarian Universalist Church</a>
   at 1893 North Vasco Road in Livermore. Most meetings start at 7:30 PM and include updates on club
   activities, short presentations by club members, a featured presentation by an invited speaker,
   and conclude with refreshments and conversation. Invited speakers have come from organizations
   such as NASA, UC Berkeley, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The TVS club meetings are
   always open to the public. <br><br>

   In lieu of a lecture meeting, we usually hold a barbecue during one of the summer club meetings
   and a potluck dinner during the December meeting. These meetings start at 7:00 PM and are devoted
   to good food and conversation. <br><br>

   The TVS board of directors meets every month on the Monday following the general club meeting.
   Board meetings are open to all club members.<br><br>

   More details about upcoming TVS meetings can be found on our 
   <a href="./index.shtml" title="Visit our home page">home page</a>.<br><br>

   <h2 class="subtitle">Public star parties</h2>
   TVS holds star parties throughout the year for the benefit of a wide variety of educational and
   recreational groups, such as ranger led programs at public parks, elementary and middle school
   science fairs, boys and girls organizations, and foundations supporting numerous charitable
   causes. These events are an opportunity for our members to share their enthusiasm for the night
   sky with the public and to promote amateur astronomy. If you are interested in having TVS come to
   your school or group, sending email
