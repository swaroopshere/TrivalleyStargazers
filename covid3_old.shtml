   Due to the COVID-19 health crisis, the following restrictions are in effect for our observing sites at Del Valle and H2O:
   <ul>
     <li>We always observe the county's COVID regulations for events at our sites.</li>
     <li>The observing sites are open for use by club members and immediate family only; no guests or group events are allowed</li>
     <li>You use the observing sites at your own risk and agree to hold the club and the landowners free of all liability</li>
     <li>Do not use either observing site if you are not feeling well or suspect you were recently exposed to the virus</li>
     <li>Announce your intention to use either site on the club's groups.io group</li>
     <li>While at either site maintain social distancing of at least 15 feet (about a car's length) or greater</li>
     <li>Bring hand sanitizer and use it before and after touching any locks or facilities</li>
     <li>H2O users should wear a mask while at the landowner's home depositing the daily usage fee</li>
     <li>H2O users that wish to use the Quick Dome should first contact Ross Gaunt to reserve it for individual use for the day</li>
