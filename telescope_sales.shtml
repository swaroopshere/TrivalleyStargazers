    <div class="content" style="width:930px;">

Tri-Valley Stargazers has surplus telescopes for sale at great prices for members.  Some are "Classics" (older models), others are more special purpose and some may be homemade by members.  The telescopes for sale are shown below, if you are interested in any of them then come to an In-Person club meeting and let our Telescope Librarian know and we can make the sale.
<br>
<br>
We know these are old but they are still useful instruments and maybe an inexpensive way to learn more about what you might like to do in astronomy, or the OTA may be of interest to you instead.  Come planning to make an offer, it likely won't get refused.
<br><br>
The closet is pretty deep, the following items are only what I can get to at the front so there will be equipment added and removed as we go.  Please let the Librarian know of your interest prior to the meetings -

<h2> Meade Lightbridge 12 inch Truss Dobsonian </h2>
<br> 
This instrument is a donation from Jack Marling, a long time club member.  Just a simple "push-to" mount but with a large mirror!  Looks much better than this when assembled but we have all the pieces.
<br>
<br>
This instrument was briefly assembled to ensure we have all the parts, coarsely collimated and then used for part of an evening before moving it to storage.  This would be a good telescope for viewing dimmer objects but because it is a "push-to" you'll need to know how to "star hop" to find specific objects that are not visible in the finder scope.  I've seen astrophotography with a 12 inch Dob, a cellphone holder and cellphone using the dark sky apps.  Surprisingly good but requires practice.

<h2> #1 Celestron Classic 8 Inch SCT OTA with AC motor drive, wedge and tripod</h2>
<br>
Sold
<br>
<br>
<h2> #2 Celestron Classic 8 Inch SCT OTA with AC motor drive, wedge and tripod</h2>
<br>
This C8 was donated within the past year or so and has stayed in storage.  Pretty much the same as the unit shown above in #1 and probably using the OTA is the best future for this one as well.

<h2> Meade Classic 8 Inch SCT OTA with AC motor drive, wedge and tripod</h2>
<br>
This was another library telescope used by members.  The main value is the OTA although if you learn how to use setting circles then you don't need a computer-aided mount.

<h2> Meade ETX 90mm, computerized</h2>
<br>
This is small telescope but with a computer-aided mount.  Maybe someone will want it for travel use.  The main issue is that it's an F14 and has a narrow field of view making it's use more difficult.  I did use it when checking it out after it was donated.  There is a future issue with this instrument, the mount: if the user allows the azimuth/RA axis to rotate twice in the same direction there may not be enough wire slack for the Elev/Dec motor in the arm resulting in the motor wires severing and no motor control.  I fixed it once already.

<h2> Meade 102mm SCT</h2>
<br>
This small format Meade telescope uses a simple mount with setting circles.  It might be a good travel telescope too when you want something for dark skies but don't have room for an 8 inch SCT.  It's an F10 giving you a 1000 mm focal length.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2> Celestron C90 OTA</h2>
<br>
This 90mm Maksutov is the OTA only.  We'd have to look at it but I recall a small dovetail so it could be mounted on a small mount for travel or maybe to a larger telescope as part of an autoguide system. Also 1000mm focal length.

<br>
<br>

<h2> Astroscan 4 Inch</h2>
<br>
This Astroscan is easy to use and portable but would mauinly be used for the moon and large planets.  It doesn't have a finder scope so finding objects is really by approximation.
