    <h1 class="title" style="width:500px;">Spring Observing Program</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
    Welcome to Spring and warmer weather for participating in astronomy.  The nights are getting a little 
    shorter but there are wonderful sights in the universe to observe!  Tri-Valley Stargazers invites you 
    to take up a simple challenge during the months of March, April and May to document your observations of 
    the 22 astronomical objects shown in the list that follows.  There are 15 Messier objects and four stars
    required for completion and three additional "Bonus" objects.  The targets for this program are at the links at the bottom of this page.
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Rules and Regulations</h2>
    To participate in this program you must be a TVS member. You should use a
    telescope with an aperture of 4 inches or greater. Observations should be
    made visually, not photographically, but using a camera to begin to develop
    those skills is worthwhile. Observe all 19 objects and possibly the 3 bonus objects and keep a log of your
    observations using the provided form or any other that includes this
    information:
    <ul>
      <li>Date and time</li>
      <li>Observing site</li>
      <li>Seeing and transparency</li>
      <li>Aperture size of telescope</li>
      <li>Power used</li>
      <li>A description of the object as it appears in the eyepiece</li>
      <li>A sketch of one object -- Messier or NGC -- is required</li>
    </ul>
    The pictures shown on the Web are just awesome and we suggest you preview
    the objects in this list so you'll have an idea of what you're going to
    observe. Look for the main features and then use your fine senses (averted
    vision and other techniques, see: <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/secrets-of-deep-sky-observing/"> 
    skyandtelescope.org/observing/secrets-of-deep-sky-observing </a>  ).
    Choose one of the Messier or NGC objects to make a sketch for your log. Use the Internet images to see finer features then return 
    to the object and see if you can observe them, add them to your sketch. Having a tablet or laptop computer at the scope makes this easier.<br>
    <br>
    Go-to telescopes are allowed, but star hopping is recommended. Star hopping
    increases one's familiarity with your equipment and with the stars and
    constellations. A camera can be used to supplement your observations but
    this approach is only for you to capture what you may not see by eye. Your
    visual observations are what we want you to report but photographs are a
    fine supplement. <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Submitting for Certification</h2>
    When you complete the suggested program you may submit your observations to
    the TVS
