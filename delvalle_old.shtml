      <h2 class="subtitle">About the Del Valle observing site</h2>

      The East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) has granted TVS a Special Usage Agreement which allows regular and
      patron club members in good standing and their guests to observe at a specified hilltop location within the park
      any night of the year beyond the 10:00 PM curfew and until daybreak.  While this site is not as dark as
      our <a href="h2o.shtml" title="Learn about the H2O observing site">Hidden Hill Observatory</a> observing site, it
      is much closer to Livermore, and therefore more convenient.  To access the Del Valle site, you need to fill out
      and sign the user agreement below and submit it to the club.  The agreement can also be found in
      a <a href="pdfs/delvalle.pdf" title="See the Del Valle user agreement form">PDF file</a>.  You must also notify
      the East Bay Parks every time you intend to use Del Valle.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Notifying Del Valle Parks</h2>
      You must notify East Bay Parks when you intend to use Del Valle.  Please send one copy of your email to each of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Park Supervisor Rick Parente rparente@ebparks.org
	</li>
	<li>
	  Del Valle Operations dvpark@ebparks.org
	</li>
	<li>
	  Dispatch dispatch@ebparks.org
	</li>
      </ul>

      Your email should include your name and cell number, your estimated arrival and departure times, and number of
      vehicles in your group.  Include a statement of the following: I am a current member of Tri-Valley Stargazers and
      approved to use the Del Valle area accessed through Gate D3.  I have reviewed my responsibilities according to the
      TVS user agreement.  I have also verified as of this email that there are no Red Flag notices listed for the <a
      href="https://www.ebparks.org/public-safety/fire/fire-warning-info">fire warning</a> web site.<br><br>


      <h2 class="subtitle">Del Valle User Agreement</h2>

      In exchange for the opportunity to use the Del Valle observing site, I agree to:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Notify the Del Valle Park Supervisor at 510-544-3141 of my intention to observe at the site, estimated
	  arrival and departure times, and the number of vehicles in my group by no later than noon of the day of my
	  visit (preferably 24 hours in advance).
        </li>
        <li>
	  Notify the East Bay Parks Police Dispatch office at 510-881-1833 of my intention to observe at the site,
	  estimated arrival and departure times, and that you'll be observing behind Gate D3.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lock the gate behind me after entering the observing site. The gate is secured with a daisy-chain of locks,
          and the TVS lock is the only combination lock. I will never dummy-lock the gate.
        </li>
        <li>
	  Never give the lock combination to the site to anyone, including other club members; only board members
	  are authorized to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
	  Drive slowly and carefully while in the park to avoid raising any dust from the dirt road.
        </li>
        <li>
	  If ten (10) vehicles are already at the site, I will park my vehicle outside the gate along the paved road to
	  Del Valle Park.
        </li>
        <li>
	  Set up at the observing site next to the fork in the fire road (about 1/4 mile from the gate) and park
	  alongside the road, leaving adequate room for emergency vehicles to pass at all times. I won't park on top
	  of any tall, dry grass to avoid accidentally starting a fire.
        </li>
        <li>
	   Abide by all the rules established by TVS and EBRPD for the use of the site. I agree that these rules may be
	  changed by TVS or EBRPD at any time. A complete listing of the EBRPD rules can be found
	  <a href="https://library.municode.com/ca/east_bay_regional_park_district/codes/ordinance_38_-_rules_and_regulations?nodeId=IN">here</a>.
	  In particular, these include:
	  <ul>
            <li>Absolutely no smoking or fires of any kind</li>
	    <li>No littering</li>
	    <li>No loud noises or music</li>
	    <li>No alcoholic beverages</li>
	  </ul>
        </li>
	<li>
	  Always personally escort any guests to and from the site and remain with them at all times while at the site.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Be responsible for ensuring that my guests abide by all the TVS and EBRPD rules while visiting the site.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Lock the gate behind me after leaving the observing site.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Carry a copy of this Agreement, counter-signed by the TVS Del Valle Coordinator or officer, with me
	  while I am at the site.
	</li>
      </ul>

      By my signature below I show that I have read and understood the above conditions for observing at the Del Valle
      site. I understand that the failure to comply with any of these conditions may result in the revocation of my
