    <h1 class="title" style="width:500px;">Autumn Observing Program</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
    Welcome to the Autumn. This is time to relax and enjoy cooler evenings and
    our skies darkening earlier. Tri-Valley Stargazers invite you to take up a
    simple challenge during the months of September, October and November to
    document your observations of the 23 astronomical objects shown in the list
    that follows. We have included a <a href="observing_autumn_spreadsheet.xls"
      title="download targets and log">spreadsheet</a> that lists the targets
    for this program and includes a log that you can use to keep track of your
    progress. You can also print these files by clicking on these links: <a href="observing_autumn_targets.pdf"
      title="Targets">target list</a> and <a href="observing_autumn_log.pdf" title="Logging form">log</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Rules and Regulations</h2>
    To participate in this program you must be a TVS member. You should use a
    telescope with an aperture of 4 inches or greater. Observations should be
    made visually, not photographically but using a camera to begin to develop
    those skills is worthwhile. Observe all 23 objects and keep a log of your
    observations using the provided form or any other that includes this
    information:
    <ul>
      <li>Date and time</li>
      <li>Observing site</li>
      <li>Seeing and transparency</li>
      <li>Aperture size of telescope</li>
      <li>Power used</li>
      <li>A description of the object as it appears in the eyepiece</li>
      <li>A sketch of one object -- Messier or NGC -- is required</li>
    </ul>
    The pictures shown on the Web are just awesome and we suggest you preview
    the objects in this list so you'll have an idea of what you're going to
    observe. Look for the main features and then use your fine senses (averted
    vision and other techniques, see:
    https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/secrets-of-deep-sky-observing/ ).
    Choose one of the Messier or NGC objects and make a sketch your observations
    taken over a period of a few nights, review the object using the Web
    photographs and see if you can observe the finer features. <br>
    <br>
    Go-to telescopes are allowed, but star hopping is recommended. Star hopping
    increases one's familiarity with your equipment and with the stars and
    constellations. A camera can be used to supplement your observations but
    this approach is only for you to capture what you may not see by eye. Your
    visual observations are what we want you to report but photographs are a
    fine supplement. <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Submitting for Certification</h2>
    When you complete the suggested program you may submit your observations to
    the TVS
