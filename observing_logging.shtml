   <h1 class="title" style="width:250px;">Log File Descriptions</h1>

   Our programs require that you document your observations. It’s also a chance to make notes about what you see as
   compared to the images on Internet. We provide a form for you to use to help you in your use of nomenclature and to
   create a consistent approach that will encourage you to attempt awards from the Astronomical League. We encourage use
   of their recommendations in this program and thank them for their forethought. <br><br>

   There are a number of things to consider when filling out a description of your session in the log file.  
   The description needs to show what makes the object unique and different from other objects of the same type.
   Providing this information will help you actually think about what it is that you are observing and not just
   recording its name.  The description should also describe details about what you saw.  You may want to think about
   things like this:
   <ul>
     <li>How big is the object?</li>
     <li>What is the object's shape (round, oval, etc.)?</li>
     <li>What is its color?</li>
     <li>Is it uniformly lit or condensed?</li>
     <li>Can you see a galaxy's arms?</li>
     <li>Can you resolve individual stars?  How dim?</li>
     <li>Is this part of a larger group (galaxy cluster, star cloud, etc.)?</li>
     <li>Do filters help?</li>
   </ul>
