   <h1 class="title" style="width:500px;">Summer Observing Program</h1>

   <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>

   Welcome to the Summer!  With the Tri-Valley blessed with clear skies and warm evenings on most summer days, this is
   the best time of year to explore the heavens.  Tri-Valley Stargazers invite you to take up a simple challenge during
   the months of June, July and August to document your observations of the 29 astronomical objects shown in the list
   that follows.  We have included a 
   <a href="observing_summer_spreadsheet.xls" title="download targets and log">spreadsheet</a> 
   that lists the targets for this program and includes a log that you can use to keep track of your progress.  You can
   also print these files by clicking on these links:  
   <a href="observing_summer_targets.pdf" title="Targets">target list</a> and 
   <a href="observing_summer_log.pdf" title="Logging form">log</a>.<br><br>

   <h2 class="subtitle">Rules and Regulations</h2>

   To participate in this program you must be a TVS member.  You should use a telescope with an aperture of 4 inches or
   greater.  Observations should be made visually, not photographically.  Observe all 29 objects and keep a log of your
   observations using the provided form or any other that includes this information:
   <ul>
     <li>Date and time</li>
     <li>Observing site</li>
     <li>Seeing and transparency</li>
     <li>Aperture size of telescope</li>
     <li>Power used</li>
     <li>A description of the object as it appears in the eyepiece</li>
     <li>An optional sketch of the object</li>
   </ul>
   Go-to telescopes are allowed, but star hopping is recommended.  Star hopping increases one's familiarity with both
   one's equipment and with the stars and constellations.<br><br>

   <h2 class="subtitle">Submitting for Certification</h2>

   When you complete the suggested program you may submit your observations to the TVS
