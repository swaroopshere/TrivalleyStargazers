     Curtis Macchioni has provided us with the
     <a href="pdfs/GSSP.pdf" title="See the slides from Curtis's talk" target="_blank">slides</a>
     from his fine talk about the Golden State Star Party.  In this summary you can find everything
     you need to know about the party, when the next party will be, where it will be, how to
     register, where to eat, what to do during the day, what to expect at night, etc.  This is a
     definite "must read" if you intend to go to the party next year.<br><br>

     Several people have taken photographs of our recent tour of the Lick Observatory.  Gert Gottschalk

     has some movies.  You can see them all on Gert's

     Rich Combs has given us his short list of carbon stars.  There are about 22 stars in this list which
     you might want to look at.  You can see his list
     <a href="pdfs/CarbonStars.pdf" title="See Rich's short list of carbon stars" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>

     Rich Combs has contributed instructions for building your own Planisphere.  The materials for
     this project will be handed out to new members that attend a meeting and to others at
     various events.  The materials are also available on the web.  His instructions can be found
     <a href="pdfs/planisphere.pdf#zoom=100&amp;pagemode=none" target="_top" title="View Rich's instructions">here</a>.
     You can learn more about this at the following sites, which also provide the materials that you will need:
