TVS has acquired donations of telescopes and accessories for a number of years and we're running out of space in our storage area.  We will make this gear available to members who come to our in-person meetings and make an offer.  You can see what's available at:

<br><br>

      TVS has a loaner scope program available to its members.<br><br>

      Renting a scope for a month or two allows you to &quot;test drive&quot; a variety of 
      scopes, whether you plan on buying one or not.  This is especially good for
      beginners who are learning the basics of using a telescope instrument.<br><br>

      We have a variety of telescopes available to rent to club members.  The rental
      rate for most scopes is $15 per month with a refundable deposit of either $50 
      or $100, depending upon the scope.<br><br>

      There are also special deals on the price. If you are a student then it is only
      $5. If you bring the telescope to one of our public or school star parties then we
      will refund your month's rental fee.<br><br>

      The telescopes are available on a first-come, first-serve basis meeting. Reservations are also accepted before the meeting by telephone or
      e-mail.  Contact the Loaner Scope Program Director, 
      <script type="text/javascript">
       <!--
        contact("telescopes", "trivalleystargazers.org", "Ron Kane");
        //-->
      </script>.

      Since this is a shared library we do ask that our renters respect other club members
      and return the instruments on a timely basis and not keep it if others are
      interested in using the telescope.<br><br>

     If you're a beginner then we suggest starting with one of our simplest instruments and then progress to a more sophisticated unit.  The simplest is the Dobsonian mount - entirely manual with no computer support.  Next try the "push-to" telescope mount that has a computer to assist your aiming to find fainter objects.  Finally we have a computerized German Equatorial Mount with "goto" pointing and suitable for astrophotography.  We also have a few "classic" telescopes (old models without computers but with "setting circles" for pointing) that are good instruments but require you to learn how star charts really work.

      In the rental telescope program we currently have:<br>
      <ul class="bullets">

<li>
        <span>
	 One 10-inch f/4.5 Coulter Odyssey Dobsonian and an Orion 8-inch Dobsonian.  These
	 are shown below as the red telescope and a simple Dob style telescope (much like the XT8i shown below).  
       <br><br>

	 The Dobs are easy to use and a have a big enough aperture to see a lot of
	 objects.  Fairly heavy when lifted in one piece, but easily handled when taken apart
	 (base and tube separated).  If you are a beginner then make use of the large number of
	 websites available to provide guidance, or ask your friendly TVS club
	 member!

	You will have to learn how to "star hop" to see fainter objects, especially in our urban light-polluted area.  You'll look for a bright star near the object you want to find and then navigate using movement in the general direction of the object or hop to other stars for guidance.

	 Orion SkyQuest XT8i Computerized IntelliScope Telescope<br><br>

	 We have two "push-to" Orion Dobsonian reflector telescopes with an 8" aperture.
	 This is big enough to let you to see faint deep-sky objects such as nebulas and galaxies.  
	 It includes the IntelliScope Computerized Object Locator to help you find
	 objects; and it has a database of more than 14,000 objects to choose
	 from.  It uses a "push-to" design in which you follow directional arrows
	 displayed on the hand controller to know which way to push the telescope
	 to center your target.  This design is very portable.  The deposit for renting
	 these telescopes is $100.<br><br>

Equatorial Mount SCTs <br> <br>

       Our German Equatorial Mount (GEM) uses the Celestron Advanced VX computerized mount and an 8-inch SCT re-purposed from one of our older telescopes.  This is our latest addition and until you've mastered the use of the Dobsonian telescopes you should wait before using this one.  It's fairly heavy, has a significant number of parts and must also be "polar-aligned" so the mount can be calibrated appropriately for locating and tracking chosen objects.  A $100 deposit is required for this instrument.

      The Dobsonian telescopes are easier to set up and operate by beginners and are recommended 
      for first time telescope users.<br><br>

      Our first ten inch scope was donated by Dr. Jack Marling.   Our second ten inch scope was donated by Conrad Stolarski. The three inch Unitron scope was donated by Jerry Howland.<br><br>

      We also have an assortment of non-telescope items for rent, including:<br>
      <ul class="bullets">
       <li>
        <span>
	 8x56 Celestron binoculars.<br><br>
         If you are new to astronomy, this is a nice way to learn your way around the sky.
	 It's much easier to get started with a low power binocular than a high power 
	 telescope, and it's much more portable!<br><br>
