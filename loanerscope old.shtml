      <h3 class="subtitle">Director: Ron Kane</h3><br>

      TVS has a loaner scope program available to its members.<br><br>

      Renting a scope for a month allows you to &quot;test drive&quot; a variety of 
      scopes, whether you plan on buying one or not.  This is especially good for
      beginners who are learning the basics of using a telescope instrument.<br><br>

      We have a variety of telescopes available to rent to club members.  The rental
      rate for most scopes is $15 per month with a refundable deposit of either $50 
      or $100, depending upon the scope.<br><br>

      There are also special deals on the price. If you are a student then it is only
      $5. If you bring the telescope to one of our public or school star parties then we
      will refund your month's rental fee.<br><br>

      The telescopes are available on a first-come, first-serve basis at each general TVS
      meeting. Reservations are also accepted before the meeting by telephone or
      e-mail.  Contact the Loaner Scope Program Director, 
      <script type="text/javascript">
       <!--
        contact("telescopes", "trivalleystargazers.org", "Ron Kane");
        //-->
      </script>.

      Since this is a shared library we do ask that our renters respect other club members
      and return the instruments on a timely basis and not keep it if others are
      interested in using the telescope.<br><br>

      In the rental telescope program we currently have:<br>

	 Orion SkyQuest XT8i Computerized IntelliScope Telescope<br><br>

	 One of our newer telescopes is an Orion Dobsonian reflector telescope with a large 8" aperture.
	 This is big enough to let you to see faint deep-sky objects such as nebulas and galaxies.  
	 It includes the IntelliScope Computerized Object Locator to help you find
	 objects; and it has a database of more than 14,000 objects to choose
	 from.  It uses a "push-to" design in which you follow directional arrows
	 displayed on the hand controller to know which way to push the telescope
	 to center your target.  This design is very portable.  The deposit for renting
	 this scope is $100.<br><br>

	 Two modified 10&quot; f/4.5 Coulter Odyssey Dobsonians<br>
         (the Jack Marling 10&quot; telescope and the Conrad Stolarski telescope).  These
	 are shown below as a red telescope.  The scopes come with a Telrad finder. The
         Marling scope comes with a Lumicon Sky Vector (a computerized pointing
	 system).<br><br>

	 Our second 10" Dob was reworked into a truss-frame assembly as the prototype for
	 our large telescope at our Hidden Hills Observatory.  This telescope appears
	 similar to the one shown beside the red Dob below.<br><br>

	 The Dobs are easy to use and a have a big enough aperture to see a lot of
	 objects.  Fairly heavy when lifted in one piece, but not too bad when taken apart
	 (base and tube separated). They take a long time to cool down to really get good
	 high power images. These are great for viewing galaxies, nebulas and other
	 &quot;Deep Sky Objects&quot; (DSOs), but not necessarily the best instrument for
	 planetary viewing.  If you are a beginner then make use of the large number of
	 websites available to provide guidance, or ask your friendly TVS club
	 member!<br><br>

	 A fully-automated Meade "LightSwitch" 8-inch SCT&nbsp;has been recently donated
	 to TVS and while it's big and looks complicated it is a great beginner instrument
	 - This one includes GPS capability and in a clear sky can set itself up
	 automatically and even tells you what it's doing and can take you on a
	 tour!<br><br>

	 See 
	 <a href="https://www.meade.com/ls-lightswitch-series-manual-size-1-9-mb/"
	 target="_blank" title="Manual">here</a> for the LightSwitch manual.<br><br>

	 We have a classic Celestron Orange Tube C8 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT).  It has
	 an AC-driven fork mount, wedge, and tripod.  You will need an inverter to run the drive
	 in the field using a battery.<br><br>

         SCTs are good all around scopes, have a big enough aperture to see many DSOs, a long 
	 focal length which makes high power planetary viewing easy, and they can track the 
	 sky. Because of the design they are physically small for the aperture and focal 
	 length, but fairly heavy.<br><br>

	 A Meade LX200 8" Classic SCT scope and tripod<br><br>

	 This scope is one of a series of telescopes offered by Meade Instruments.  The series 
	 is regarded by some as one of the best telescopes for astrophotograhy offered by
   	 Meade.  But it is also very well suited to visual work, and is easy to operate with
  	 its built-in alignment procedure, large star catalog, and "go-to" controller that makes
	 aiming at a target a simple process.<br><br>

	 Both the Meade and Celestron "classic" scopes have a mount wedge that allows them
	 to be used as equatorial mounts.  This is needed for long photographic
	 exposuures.  Learning to use a manual equatorial mount is a worthwhile task.  The
	 Meade has a 12 VDC inverter for operation away from AC power.<br><br>

	 75mm (3&quot;) f/16 Unitron refractor on a German equatorial mount and tripod<br>
         (the Jerry Howland Telescope). Scope has a small finder scope.<br><br>

         This is a long focal length achromatic refractor. It's great for planetary or 
	 lunar viewing, but the aperture is kind of small for most DSO work. The mount 
	 and tripod are very sturdy.<br><br>
        </span>

      </ul>

      The Dobsonian telescopes are easier to set and use for beginners and are recommended 
      for first time telescope users.<br><br>
<!--
      The Jack Marling six inch Telescope is currently having the mount repaired and is 
      unavailable for rental. Feel free to direct any further questions to the Rental 
      Telescope Program Director, Ron Kane.<br><br>
-->

      Our first ten inch scope, with the Sky Vector computer, was donated by Dr. Jack Marling. 
      Our second ten inch scope was donated by Conrad Stolarski. The three inch Unitron 
      scope was donated by Jerry Howland.<br><br>

      We also have an assortment of non-telescope items for rent, including:<br>
      <ul class="bullets">
       <li>
        <span>
	 8x56 Celestron binoculars.<br><br>
         If you are new to astronomy, this is a nice way to learn your way around the sky.
	 It's much easier to get started with a low power binocular than a high power 
	 telescope, and it's much more portable!<br><br>
