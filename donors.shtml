   <h1 class="title" style="width:600px;">Donations to TVS Reconstruction</h1>
   In the wake of the SCU Lightning Complex Wildfire that destroyed the H2O main observatory there was an outpouring of
   generosity to TVS from astronomy enthusiasts worldwide.  The most immediately noticeable outpouring came in the form
   of monetary contributions to the TVS Observatory Rebuilding Fund. In excess of $40,000 dollars was contributed through
   GoFundMe Charity, PayPal, Benevity matching funds, and personal checks.  Since the fire
   about a dozen people and organizations contacted TVS to offer temporary and permanent equipment donations. In
   many instances, careful negotiation was required between the parties to assess preconditions on donations, such as the
   usefulness of equipment for the vision TVS is developing for observatory replacement, whether permission would be
   granted to TVS to sell equipment to use the money towards our rebuilding effort, and careful consideration of donation
   worth for providing tax receipts for accepted equipment. <br><br>

   We are pleased to announce a major donation to the TVS by David Friedberg, CEO of
   <a href="https://www.theproductionboard.com/" title="Visit The Production Board" target="_blank">The Production Board</a>, 
   of a 20" PlaneWave Corrected Dall-Kirkham (CDK) Telescope, a Mathis MI-750 Fork mount, and a motorized 3.5 meter
   Observa-DOME! Mr. Friedberg received a degree in astrophysics from UC Berkeley in 2001.  This donation was brokered by
   Prof. Alex Filippenko of UC Berkeley.<br><br>
