<h1 class="title" style="width: 500px;">Observing Programs</h1>

    
<h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>

    We offer several observing programs to TVS club members. These programs are
    designed to help you improve your observing skills and familiarity with the
    best deep-sky objects in the sky during each season. If you complete a
    program, it should make you more comfortable in participating in the club's
    outreach events and prepare you for participating in the Astronomical
    League's more extensive <a href="https://www.astroleague.org/observing.html" title="Learn about Astroleague programs" target="_blank">observing
      programs</a>. Our programs are designed to be completed by an individual
    in a single season. Some programs may require a 4-inch or greater telescope.
    Certificates will be awarded to members who complete a program.<br>

    <br>

    
<h2 class="subtitle">Observing Techniques</h2>

    Many of our programs require that you record information about how good the
    seeing and sky transparency were. There are many ways to do this, but you
    can read <a href="observing_techniques.shtml" title="techniques">here</a>
    for simple techniques that are suitable for our programs.<br>

    <br>

    Also do not overlook the resources on the Internet for learning about
    astronomy, telescopes and how to expand your skills. Observing is a
    particular skill required for astronomy and must be developed, this includes
    the ability to see features that may be fleeting when you do direct
    observation. We recommend that you use Internet to research each object in a
    program before doing your own observations. Online images are spectacular in
    comparison to what you'll see in a smaller aperture however you may be able
    to see many of the same features -- outer stars may be resolved when looking
    at globular clusters, the colors of Albireo will be more apparent after
    you've prepared yourself, the dimensions of a lunar crater can be
    appreciated after you've researched it online. Prepare yourself for the
    differences of what you see in a Hubble image and what you observe yourself
    and understand why. Look for the small features and you&rsquo;ll learn to see the
    features acquired from large instruments. Get inspired!<br>

    <br>

    
<h2 class="subtitle">Logging</h2>

    To complete our programs, you will need to submit a log of what you saw and
    the conditions for your observations. We provide logs in Excel format and
    PDF format as one way for you to do this, and you can read <a href="observing_logging.shtml" title="logging">here</a> for ideas on what information to include.<br>

    <br>

    
<h2 class="subtitle">Awards</h2>

    We have created a number of observing programs as to create easy to
    accomplish goals for exploring the night skies. These activities are
    selected for seasonal observations as well as introductory activities
    paralleling the Astronomical League and other astronomy club programs. When
    you complete one of the programs you may submit your observations to the TVS
