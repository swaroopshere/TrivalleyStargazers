<h1 class="title" style="width: 500px;">Observing Programs</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>
   We offer several observing programs to TVS club members.  These programs are designed to help you
   improve your observing skills and familiarity with the best deep-sky objects in the sky during
   each season.  If you complete a program, it should make you more comfortable in participating in
   the club's outreach events and prepare you for participating in the Astronomical League's more
   extensive 
      <a href="https://www.astroleague.org/observing.html" title="Learn about Astroleague programs" target="_blank">observing programs</a>.

   Our programs are designed to be completed by an individual in a single season.  Some programs may
   require a 4-inch or greater telescope.  Certificates will be awarded to members who complete a
   program.<br>

<h2 class="subtitle">Observing Techniques</h2>
   Many of our programs require that you record information about how good the seeing and sky transparency were.  There
   are many ways to do this, but you can read
   <a href="observing_techniques.shtml" title="techniques">here</a>
   for simple techniques that are suitable for our programs.<br>
<br>
   Also do not overlook the resources on the Internet for learning about astronomy, telescopes and how to expand your
   skills. Observing is a particular skill required for astronomy and must be developed, this includes the ability to
   see features that may be fleeting when you do direct observation. We recommend that you use Internet to research each
   object in a program before doing your own observations. Online images are spectacular in comparison to what you'll
   see in a smaller aperture however you may be able to see many of the same features - outer stars may be resolved
   when looking at globular clusters, the colors of Albireo will be more apparent after you've prepared yourself, the
   dimensions of a lunar crater can be appreciated after you've researched it online. Prepare yourself for the
   differences of what you see in a Hubble image and what you observe yourself and understand why. Look for the small
   features and you'll learn to see the features acquired from large instruments. Get inspired!<br>
<br>
<h2 class="subtitle">Logging</h2>
   To complete our programs, you will need to submit a log of what you saw and the conditions for your observations.
   We provide logs in Excel format and PDF format as one way for you to do this, and you can read
   <a href="observing_logging.shtml" title="logging">here</a>
   for ideas on what information to include.<br>
<br>
<h2 class="subtitle">Awards</h2>
    We have created a number of observing programs for exploring the night skies. These activities are
    selected for seasonal observations as well as introductory activities
    paralleling the Astronomical League and other astronomy club programs. When
    you complete one of the programs you may submit your observations to the TVS
