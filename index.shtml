<b> Citizen Science, Variable Stars, and the AAVSO </b>
<br>

Dr. Brian Kloppenborg 
<br><br>
Abstract: 
"Citizen Science, Variable Stars, and the AAVSO" introduces the exciting world of citizen
science in astronomy, focusing on how you can actively contribute to scientific discovery. The
talk covers engaging citizen science projects, such as those on Zooniverse, and collaborations
like JunoCAM, IOTA, and SAS. It includes a detailed look at variable stars, featuring examples
like SS Cyg, T CrB, and Cepheid variables, and highlights recent discoveries, such as the Great
Dimming of Betelgeuse and the newly discovered Iota Del. Finally, the talk introduces the
AAVSO, its resources, and how you can start observing variable stars either visually or digitally.

Bio: Dr. Brian Kloppenborg is an astrophysicist and entrepreneur currently serving as the Executive
Director of the AAVSO. He earned a Ph.D. in Physics with an astrophysics specialization from
the University of Denver and a B.A. in Physics from Hastings College. Before joining the
AAVSO, Dr. Kloppenborg worked as a Research Scientist at the Georgia Tech Research
Institute, where he led multidisciplinary teams as a subject matter expert, lead engineer, product
owner, and project director.
Dr. Kloppenborgâ€™s research focuses on combining photometry, spectroscopy, astrometry, and
long-baseline optical interferometry to deepen our understanding of eclipsing binaries, novae,
and young stellar objects. His work has been published in esteemed journals, including Nature,
The Astrophysical Journal, and the Journal of the AAVSO.
Throughout his career, Dr. Kloppenborg has been dedicated to fostering collaboration between
amateur and professional astronomers, advancing scientific discovery, and promoting
educational outreach in astronomy.

   <h3 class="subtitle">June's meeting</h3>
   <!-- Next year be sure to invite family members, esp. Sue!  -->
   Our June meeting will be our annual Summer BBQ. Plan on working up an appetite by
   helping to set-up and get the charcoal going at about 5:30pm. We will start eating
   around 6:00pm.  <br><br>
   The club will provide hamburgers, hotdogs and vegetarian black bean burgers,
   along with a variety of toppings.  If you wish, provide side dishes for your family, but not
   to be shared with members because of COVID.<br><br>

  <div class="optional" id="opt_h2o">
  <h3 class="subtitle">H2O Open House</h3>

   Our next open house is September 28, 2024 for the club's dark sky site, 
   <a href="h2o.shtml" title="Learn more about the TVS's Hidden Hill Observatory">Hidden Hill Observatory</a>, 
   aka H2O.  <br><br>

   Anyone can come to our open houses, not just club members; but you cannot go
   there without an escort.  We will meet at the corner of Mines and Tesla Roads
   at 5:00 PM, then caravan to the site on a drive that takes about 50 minutes.
   The admission is $3/car; please bring the exact amount.  There is no gas on
   the way, so be sure to gas up before leaving.  The site is essentially in the
   wilderness, so there is no electricity and water, and there are only a couple
   of pit toilets.  Cell-phone reception is iffy at best.  While there is a
   picnic table there, you really should bring your own chair.  If you need to
   see what you are doing, bring a red LED flashlight, not a white-light
   flashlight.  And use masking tape over your car door and interior lights, or
   pull the fuse.  If you don't have a scope, you can always find someone who is
   willing to let you look through theirs.  And don't forget to bring your
   binoculars.  Expect to stay until about midnight and get back to Livermore at
   around 1:00 AM.<br><br>

   Tesla Vintner star parties are generally open to club members and their guests.  The star parties will run from 6:00 PM
   until midnight.  Tesla Vintners is in Livermore near the intersection of Tesla and Mines.  For
   those new to the site, please use the unmarked west entrance (closest to Mines) to enter the
   winery grounds.<br><br>
