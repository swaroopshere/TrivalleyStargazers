       <h2 class="subtitle">School Outreach Star Parties</h2>

       During the school year, TVS will conduct outreach star parties for teachers and the students at their school. We 
       also do outreach star parties for other groups, such as boy's and girl's organizations and charitable
       groups. If you are interested in the club coming to your school or group, send an e-mail to the star party

       <h2 class="subtitle">Public Outreach Star Parties</h2>

       TVS conducts public outreach star parties every year at such places as <b>Del Valle Regional Park</b> near
       Livermore. We also conduct a yearly outreach star party at <b>Yosemite</b> for a couple of nights. <br><br>

       <b>Del Valle Regional Park</b> is south of Livermore.  Star parties are held at the 
       <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Del+Valle+Arroyo+Road+Staging+Area+(EBRPD)/@37.619661,-121.752925,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x808fdc4545c11aa9:0x28a34b4f6c5c078b!8m2!3d37.6196608!4d-121.7529251">
       Arroyo Road Staging Area</a>, mear 5055
       Arroyo Road. This location is NOT near the Del Valle main entrance, but is on Arroyo Road (an extension of L
       Street), past the Wente Restaurant. From Downtown Livermore, take L Street south, and continue as it becomes
       Arroyo Road. The Arroyo Road Staging Area is on the left, about 0.8 miles past the Wente Restaurant and the
       turnoff to the Veterans Hospital.<br><br>

       The <b>Yosemite</b> Star Party is held during the summer months. Tri-Valley Stargazers hosts star parties on top
       of Glacier Point in exchange for free camping at the Bridalveil Creek campgrounds.  <br><br>

       Check our home page for public outreach star party details (as they become available).<br><br>

       <a name="club"></a>
       <h2 class="subtitle">Club Star Parties</h2>

       
       Our <b>Tesla Vintners</b> star parties are open to members and their guests only.  We arrange special after-hours access
       to the site, usually four times per year.  Star party dates are published on our
       <a href="index.shtml" title="see our home page">home page</a> as they are scheduled.
       Although the winery is closed during the star parties, it is still a great location for observing, since it has
       fairly dark skies for being so close to Livermore.  Check 
       <a href="http://teslavintners.com/index.html" title="Visit Tesla Vintners' web site" target="_blank">
         their web site</a> for information on wine tasting during the day. <br><br>

       
       In addition, we generally have two open houses at our dark sky site,
       <a href="h2o.shtml" title="Hidden Hills">Hidden Hill Observatory (H2O)</a>. The public is invited to these events as outreach and introduction to TVS resources.<br><br>

       For our <b>H2O Open Houses</b>, various members' telescopes will be available for public viewing.  Our main
       observatory is no longer available because it was destroyed by recent wildfires.
       We meet at the corner of Mines and Tesla Roads in Livermore, and caravan to the site (a one-hour
       drive). Do not attempt to drive directly to the site unless you are an experienced key holding TVS member. If you
       are not a key holding member, and you drive directly to the site, you will not be admitted. To find out about
       becoming a keyholding member, visit our 
       <a href="h2o.shtml" title="Hidden Hills">H2O web page</a>. <br><br>

       To get to the assembly place, from I-580 take the Vasco Road exit and go south on Vasco Road about four miles to
       the end of the road. Turn right on Tesla Road. Mines Road will be the first left, about 0.4 miles. There is a $3
       per car fee at H2O, which is part of our rental agreement for the hilltop. Exact payment please - there is no way to make change. <br><br>

       <h2 class="subtitle">Nearby Non-TVS Star Parties</h2>

       There are several non-TVS star party gatherings in Northern and Central California:<br><br>

       <a class="link" title="GSSP" href="http://goldenstatestarparty.org/" target="_blank">Golden State Star Party</a><br>
       The Golden State Star Party is held near Adin, CA. At an elevation of 4,400', atop a large bluff, the skies are
       very dark. Tent camping and RVs welcome (no hook ups though). There will be some amenities provided.  Curtis
       Macchioni has provided us with a nice 
       <a href="pdfs/GSSP.pdf" title="See Curtis's slides" target="_blank">summary</a> of this event.<br><br>

       <a class="link" title="CalStar" href="http://calstar.observers.org/" target="_blank">CalStar</a><br>
       CalStar is a regional dark-sky star party held twice a year in April and September in Monterey County,
       California.  The event format and atmosphere are quite casual, and there are no scheduled activities, vendors, or
       fees other than the camping fee collected at the park entrance.  CalStar is sponsored by the 
       <a href="https://www.sjaa.net/" title="SJAA" target="_blank">San Jose Astronomical Association</a>
       and Left Coast Observers. <br><br>

       <a class="link" title="Barcroft" href="https://www.wmrc.edu/" target="_blank">Barcroft</a><br>
       The Barcroft High Altitude Star Party is sponsored by the 
       <a title="East Bay Astro" href="http://eastbayastro.org/" target="_blank"> East Bay Astronomical Society</a>. 
       It is held at the University of California's 
       <a title="Barcroft" href="https://www.wmrc.edu/" target="_blank">Barcroft</a> High Altitude Research Station,
       located in the White Mountain Range on the east side of the Owens Valley in California. The remoteness of the
       location, plus an altitude of approximately 12,450 feet above sea level, affords visiting amateur astronomers
       truly world-class viewing conditions that are relatively affordable and easy to access.<br><br>
